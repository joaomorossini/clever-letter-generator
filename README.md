### 2. Features
The Clever Letter Generator is a Flask-based web application that uses AI to generate custom cover letters. It includes the following features:

- Unauthenticated use: Users can use the app without logging in, but their cvs and cover letter logs will only be stored in the current session, not in the database
- User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in to access the cover letter generator.
- Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse, the application limits the number of requests a user can make per minute or per day.
- Secure Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt.
- Email Support: The application uses Flask-Mail for email functionality.
- API Key Management: API calls covered by site owner.
- Cover Letter Generation: Users can generate a custom cover letter by providing details such as job title, job description, employer name, employer description, and additional instructions.
- Downloadable Cover Letters: Generated cover letters can be downloaded as text files.
- Logging: The application logs each cover letter generation event for auditing purposes.
